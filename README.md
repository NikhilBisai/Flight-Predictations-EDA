What Problem I Solved:
I tackled the problem of understanding the key factors that influence flight ticket prices by analyzing a complex dataset containing flight details. The goal was to uncover patterns and insights that could help predict fares more accurately and support data-driven decision-making in the travel industry.


What I Did:
1) Collected and explored the flight fare dataset with features like airline, journey date, source, destination, stops, duration, and price.

2) Cleaned the data by handling missing values and correcting inconsistent entries to improve data quality.

3) Engineered new features such as journey day, month, and total flight duration for better analysis.

4) Used Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy) for data processing and manipulation.

5) Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify relationships between variables and ticket prices.

6) Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight important trends and patterns.

7) Found that factors such as airline, number of stops, route, and travel date significantly impact ticket prices.

8) Gained practical experience in data cleaning, feature extraction, visualization, and insight generation.

9) Laid the groundwork for building machine learning models to predict flight fares in the future.

This project strengthened my data analysis skills by giving me hands-on experience with real-world datasets. It enhanced my ability to clean and preprocess data, extract meaningful features, and use visualization techniques to communicate insights effectively. Overall, it prepared me well for tackling more advanced predictive modeling and data-driven decision-making tasks in the field of data science.
